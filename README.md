# Lost Cities LTS

This fork is based on the *Survive The Dead Edition* fork by Burchard36 to maintain their tile entity bug fixes. Credit to them for their work on the tile entity code. 

**What is this fork and why does it exist?**
This fork aims to create a Long Term Support version of *Lost Cities* for Minecraft 1.12.2. It aims to patch all existing bugs, backport features from the newest versions of Lost Cities, and add additional features for use in *Cyclone Modding* projects. Unlike other 1.12 LC forks, *Lost Cities LTS* will try to actively fix issues even if they don't benefit our projects. The main purpose of this fork is to increase support for static placement features for use in SAM-Worlds, but it will eventually also have parity with new LC versions to include features like increased multi building sizes.
